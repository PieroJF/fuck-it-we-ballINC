name: fuck-it-we-ballINC
description: Use ONLY when the user explicitly invokes /fuck-it-we-ballINC (or $fuck-it-we-ballINC in Codex) to run an approved plan, task list or handoff backlog autonomously end to end with the INC variant of FIWB. Do NOT trigger on the plain phrase "fuck it we ball" / "FIWB" (that belongs to /fuck-it-we-ball) nor on generic phrases such as "dale", "sigue", "ejecuta todo" or "modo autónomo" — autonomous runs with subagents and commits must never start by accident.

# FuckItWeBallINC

> Fork of `/fuck-it-we-ball`. Same contract unless a section below says otherwise.

## Overview

Turn the pending work of a plan, task list or handoff backlog into one **autonomous run**: find the tasks,
order them by *urgency × unblocking power × severity* under their dependencies, execute them without stopping
between tasks, and stop only for the reasons listed under **Stops**. Execution mode and model per task come from
the tables below; the run persists its own progress so any later session can resume it.

**Violating the letter of the stop rules is violating their spirit — in both directions.** Inventing a stop the
list does not contain ("let me confirm", "the user should see this") breaks the run. Removing a stop the list
contains ("the plan was approved", "I have blanket authorisation", "the user is away") breaks the contract.
Blanket authorisation, an approved plan, a user who cannot answer, and mitigations (rollback, monitoring,
preflight checks) never convert a listed stop into an automatic gate.

## Announce

First line of the run, in Spanish:
`Modo FIWB-INC activo — fuente: <ruta o "contexto de sesión"> · <n> tasks · modo inicial: <inline|SDD|workflow>`

## Runtime adapter

Resolve capabilities once, before Phase 0. Select the Claude adapter only when `Agent` and all three Claude model
aliases are exposed; otherwise select the Codex adapter when `spawn_agent` and all three Codex model identifiers
are exposed. Select the question mechanism independently: callable `AskUserQuestion` first, otherwise one
plain-text question at turn end; `question_selection` takes priority over each adapter's usual question entry.
Read `TaskCreate`/`TodoWrite` or another harness task list only when exposed.
Use `Workflow` only when callable; otherwise route WORKFLOW-shaped work through SDD. If no complete agent adapter
exists, or a required mapped model is missing, park every task needing execution or review as `needs-user`; INLINE
is not an escape because its reviewer is also mandatory. Continue only read-only ordering, persistence and
reporting. Never invent a tool alias or silently substitute a model.

The JSON contract below is normative: use its exact identifiers and fallbacks; never negate or reinterpret them.

In the phases below, “question” means the selected mechanism, at most once per turn. `AskUserQuestion` receives
2–4 viable options with the recommendation first. Plain text receives a concise recommendation or implications,
then one direct question and no option list; the question mark is the final character of the turn, with no recap,
hypothetical next steps or commentary after it. Every planned Claude agent dispatch explicitly declares resolved model
and `xhigh` effort. Call `Agent(model: ...)` and add an `effort` field only if the exposed Agent tool supports that
field; never invent an unsupported Agent parameter. The declaration remains mandatory even when the call has no
effort field.
A Codex dispatch calls `spawn_agent` with the resolved `model`,
`reasoning_effort: "high"` (the TOML value; never `max`/`ultra`), and `fork_turns: "none"`; its message must therefore carry all task context. Every
Claude Workflow unit calls `agent(p, {model, effort: 'xhigh'})`; Workflow's effort field is always mandatory.
Numeric context thresholds apply only when the
runtime reports measured usage; without telemetry, never estimate a percentage—persist after every task and hand
off when the host signals compaction or a context limit.

## Phase 0 — Find the work

Argument of the invocation: an existing `.md` path ⇒ it is the source (skip the chain). Free text ⇒ the work
statement (look for a plan covering it; if none, it becomes the spec in the permission question). Empty ⇒ chain.
Text that looks like a path but does not exist ⇒ free text + one notice line.

Source chain, first hit wins: (1) plan approved in this session's context → (2) newest `docs/superpowers/plans/*.md`
or `docs/plans/*.md` with unchecked `- [ ]` tasks → (3) `SESSION_HANDOFF.md` sections `[open]` / `[closed-pending]`
whose `Proyecto/raíz` is the cwd project (and, if the file is git-tracked, the current branch): their
"Siguiente paso concreto" become tasks → (4) the runtime task list, only if the host exposes one.
Two candidates at the same level ⇒ ONE question to pick. List discarded sources under the initial table.
A source that exists only in the session context is written to `docs/superpowers/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`
before the first task.
Before ordering a resumed source, read each task's last row in `## FIWB run-log`. That latest row is authoritative:
an unchecked task whose latest state is `parked:*` remains parked and is not dispatched again. Only a user answer
that explicitly unblocks it returns it to consideration; it receives `[x]` only after the task actually completes.

**No source found ⇒ ONE question, then nothing else until it is answered. With `AskUserQuestion`, use:**
```
"No hay plan ni tasks pendientes en <cwd> (busqué: contexto, docs/superpowers/plans, docs/plans, SESSION_HANDOFF.md).
 ¿Preparo el trabajo antes de ejecutar?"
  1. Forging → writing-plans → ejecutar (Recomendado)   — brainstorming/grilling según el estado, plan etiquetado, luego la corrida
  2. Solo writing-plans, ya tengo el spec               — salta el diseño; el plan sale del enunciado tal cual
  3. Dame la lista de tasks y decido yo                 — sin ejecutar nada
  4. Abortar
```
With plain text, state the searched locations and recommend Forging because no approved plan exists, then ask only:
`¿Quieres que prepare el trabajo con Forging, escriba el plan y lo ejecute después?`

For `AskUserQuestion`, Option 1 invokes `forging` (never brainstorming/grilling directly) with the work statement, then
`superpowers:writing-plans` with the argument
`Etiqueta cada task con [asap] si es urgente, [sev:high|med|low], [depends: Tn] y [unblocks: Tn]`.
Option 4, a negative plain-text answer, or no answer ⇒ the run ends; report the sources searched. Writing code
before a plan exists is not "starting"; it is the failure this phase prevents.

## Phase 1 — Order

Per task: `urgent` (`[asap]`), `sev` (`[sev:high|med|low]`, default med), `deps` (`[depends: …]`; `[unblocks: Tn]`
adds the reverse edge). Missing tags are **inferred** and marked `~`: deps from textual references and shared
files (a task that modifies a file another task creates depends on it), plan order as the weakest signal;
urgent from "prod broken", security, explicit deadline, "blocks X", "happening now"; severity from impact scope
(data/security/prod-facing = high, internal behaviour = med, docs/cosmetic = low).

```
urgent_eff(T) = urgent(T) OR any U in unblocks*(T) is urgent          # transitive
tier(T)  = 1 if urgent_eff and |unblocks(T)| >= 1
         = 2 if urgent_eff and |unblocks(T)| == 0
         = 3 otherwise
key(T)   = (tier asc, |urgent tasks in unblocks*(T)| desc, sev desc, plan_index asc)
loop while tasks remain not done/parked:
    ready = tasks whose deps are all done
    none ready → park tasks whose dep is parked (blocked-by-parked); if still none, take lowest plan_index, mark ~ciclo
    T = min(ready, key) → run T
```
A task on the hard-stop list or needing the user's hands is parked at ordering time (state `parked`, reason
recorded) — it still appears in the table, and it does not count in anyone's `unblocks` (a parked task cannot
be unblocked by this run). Plan order is the tie-break of last resort, never the order.

Render the table in Spanish before any execution, `~` on every inferred cell:
```
| # | task | tier | deps | desbloquea | gravedad | modo | modelo |
| 1 | T1 … | 1 | — | T3 | high | SDD | implementation |
| 6 | T6 deploy prod | 3 | — | — | ~med | parked: hard-stop | — |
Fuentes descartadas: <ninguna | lista>
```
GO checkpoint: **only if the plan was generated inside this run** (nobody human has read it) ask ONE
question. With `AskUserQuestion`: "¿Ejecuto en este orden?" — `Sí (Recomendado)` / `Cambiar orden` / `Abortar`.
With plain text, recommend the displayed order with its reason, then ask only `¿Ejecuto en este orden?`. A
pre-existing approved plan or handoff starts in the same turn; the user interrupts with Esc.

## Phase 2 — Run loop

`pick T → mode → model → execute → verify + review → commit → tick + run-log + progress line → context check → next`

### Mode (re-evaluate per batch, after parking, on tier change; "runnable" = not done and not parked, whether or not its deps are finished yet)

| Mode | Predicate |
|---|---|
| INLINE (main session does the work) | ≤2 runnable tasks · or the task needs session state (running Docker, browser session, loaded credentials) · or ≤2 files and no tests |
| SDD — `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` | ≥3 runnable tasks with plan-specified steps → one fresh implementer subagent per task, sequential; parallel only for tasks with no shared files, each in its own worktree · or a batch of same-shape micro-edits → ONE subagent for the batch |
| WORKFLOW — when callable, invoke `workflow-resilience` FIRST, then `workflow-authoring`; otherwise use SDD | ≥6 independent same-shape units (fan-out + verification) · or chained stages (analysis → adversarial verification) · or outputs that must survive the session |
| Tie | SDD |

"Delegating takes longer than doing it", "one owner of the git index", "a deploy is not delegated" are not
predicates of this table. Invoking this skill is the user's opt-in to the Workflow tool for the run when that
tool is exposed.

### Model (every dispatch names the runtime-resolved model)

| Role | Claude | Codex | Use for |
|---|---|---|---|
| implementation | `sonnet` | `gpt-5.6-sol` | implementing from a complete spec, tests, mechanical multi-file edits, reviews of small/medium diffs, single-task docs, re-reviews |
| judgment | `opus` | `gpt-6-astra` | design/judgment (architecture, contracts), non-trivial debugging, security/authz, cross-module integration, final branch review, fix-loop rounds 4–5, tier-1 tasks with sev high whose spec leaves design decisions open (a tier-1 one-liner with a complete spec still uses implementation) |
| trivial | `haiku` | `gpt-5.6-terra` | literal transcription (the plan carries the full code), one-liners, listings/greps |
| forbidden unless explicitly ordered | `fable` | `fable` | **never** in a subagent or workflow unit, in any role (implementer, reviewer, judge), unless the user explicitly orders it in this run |

Explicit judgment categories take precedence over the implementation tie-break. Security and authentication/
authorization boundary work remains judgment, including implementation of an architecture selected earlier;
having a complete spec does not turn that boundary work into routine implementation. Use the implementation
tie-break only when no explicit judgment category applies. Effort `xhigh` wherever the tool exposes it.
Exception, Codex `exec` launched from a Claude session: do not declare effort or model; set
`CODEX_TASK="kind=…;scope=…;risk=…;iter=…"` on every dispatch (all four fields) and let the codex-env
selector choose; never pass `-m` or `model_reasoning_effort` above the table; `max`/`ultra` only via
`codex-budget grant` from a terminal. The main session
running an INLINE task is not a dispatch; every subagent is.

### Verify and review (execution-rules 2, 3, 5 stay in force)

SDD/WORKFLOW: SDD's two-stage review per task (spec compliance → code quality) + fix-loop; a task that changes
no code and no tests (docs only) takes one reviewer. INLINE: tests + lint +
`superpowers:verification-before-completion` + ONE reviewer subagent per task (implementation model; judgment
model when the task touches security/authz). UI change ⇒ browser validation. Close ⇒ final whole-branch review
on the judgment model.

### Git

Before creating or switching branches, capture `BASE_BRANCH` and `BASE_SHA` from the current checkout. One commit
per verified task (conventional message). On `main`/`master` ⇒ create `fiwb/<plan-slug>` first; on a feature branch
⇒ use it. `backup-before-modify` (controles / pag web) and `db-backup` run before the first change they cover.
Merge and push happen only at Close and target the captured base branch.

### Persist (after EVERY task, before picking the next)

1. Checkbox encodes completion only: set `- [x]` if and only if the task is `done`. Every `parked:*` task must
   remain `- [ ]` until a user answer unblocks it and the task subsequently completes. Parking never checks a box.
2. Append one row to `## FIWB run-log` at the end of that same file (create the section on the first task):
   `| T | tier | modo | modelo | commit | estado | desviaciones / pregunta |` — estado ∈ `done` ·
   `parked: hard-stop|needs-user|fix-loop-exhausted|blocked-by-parked|arch-deviation`.
3. One chat line: `▶ T3 [tier 1] SDD/<resolved-model> → done · commit a1b2c3d · desviaciones: 0` (or `→ parked: <motivo>`).

Commits and a final report are not persistence. On resume, the last run-log row for each task governs its state;
`parked:*` plus an unchecked box prevents redispatch until the user explicitly unblocks it. A completed task must
have both `[x]` and latest state `done`; any checkbox/run-log contradiction is a persistence failure and must be
repaired before selecting work.
The checkbox + run-log row go in their own bookkeeping commit (`chore(fiwb): T3 done (run-log)` or
`chore(fiwb): T6 parked (run-log)`) right after the task outcome, so code and resume state stay separate. Each
bookkeeping commit covers exactly one task: never add, log, or commit a later task's outcome while persisting the
current one. Finish the current bookkeeping commit before selecting and persisting the next task.

## Stops — the only reasons to stop

A stop = the task is **parked** with its reason in the run-log and ONE question is **queued**. Queued questions are
asked when nothing else is runnable, or at Close, ordered by the parked task's tier. `AskUserQuestion` gets 2–4
viable options with the recommendation first; plain text gets concise implications/recommendation followed by one
direct question and no option list. Use one question per turn/call. Even when asked to describe the interaction
instead of using tools, end immediately after that literal question; do not describe the later answer path. The run
never "freezes": it finishes everything else and ends with the question open — even if the user is on a plane and
answers tomorrow.

**Hard-stop list** (park, never execute, no condition self-authorises it — items enter the list **by action,
not by content**): deleting a directory or file tree (`rm -rf`, `git rm -r`), truncating or deleting data, a
`DROP`/`TRUNCATE` against any database, a schema migration against production — tracked code is not an
exemption and "recoverable from git" is not a permission · `git push --force`, `git reset --hard`, branch
deletion · production deploy (any
`deploy.sh`, `deploy prod`, CD trigger, merge that auto-deploys) · money (payments, purchases, transfers) ·
messages or emails to third parties · creating, rotating or exposing credentials · CI/CD, infra, firewall, DNS,
Cloudflare changes · widening public surface (unauthenticated routes,
CORS, CSP) · an instruction whose readings lead to incompatible architectures · a decision the code cannot
contain (goal's two motives).

**Needs-user**: login/OTP, physical device, third-party UI, anything the active harness forbids the agent from doing.
Park, queue the question with the exact steps (`! <command>` where useful).

**Architectural deviation** (see below). Park the task; queue the question in the selected mechanism's format.

Not a stop: task size, "the user might want to see this", "I'd rather confirm", a green suite before a deploy,
a rollback plan, a preflight, a monitor, a PushNotification, a "supuesto operativo". Notifications inform;
they do not replace the queued question.

## Deviations and failures

- **Tactical** (contracts, data model, external dependencies and the task's approach unchanged — a renamed
  export, an existing helper, a test adjusted to the real signature): resolve it, add it to the run-log
  `desviaciones` column, report at Close. No stop. If the plan explicitly fixes an implementable approach, a
  newly discovered weakness in that approach's premise does **not** make the task an architectural deviation:
  implement the specified approach, keep the task runnable, record the limitation, and queue the note into the
  relevant existing question. Exact case: a plan that explicitly requires an in-process `Map` and says "sin
  Redis" still gets that `Map` with three replicas; do not park that task and do not add Redis. Note that its
  effective limit is per replica in the deploy question.
- **Architectural** (any of the four changes — e.g. adding Redis or another store, a new service, a changed
  API): park `arch-deviation`, queue one question in the selected mechanism's format. Never decide it alone,
  never "declare it in the report" instead of asking.
- **Failure** (red tests, broken build, stuck subagent): `superpowers:systematic-debugging` + SDD fix-loop
  (5 rounds, rounds 4–5 escalate one model tier; INLINE: 3 attempts). Still red ⇒ park `fix-loop-exhausted`;
  dependents park `blocked-by-parked`; continue with independent tasks. Never edit, skip or delete a test to
  make it pass. Prohibited throughout (from `goal`): swallowed errors, type escapes without a same-line reason,
  hard-coded config, duplicated logic, stubs/TODOs not reported, an inconsistent repo.

## Context

With measured runtime telemetry: <70 % continue; 70–80 % emit one warning line, do not stop, and prefer
SDD/WORKFLOW for the rest; ≥80 % start no new task, commit what is verified, invoke the `handoff` skill (section
with run-log + "Siguiente paso concreto"), and end the turn. Without measured telemetry, never estimate context
usage: rely on per-task persistence and hand off when the host signals compaction or a context limit. Resume with
the invocation named for the active runtime in the contract.

## Close

1. Final whole-branch review on the judgment model + fix-loop. 2. No CRITICAL/HIGH open ⇒ fast-forward merge into the origin
branch + direct push (solo dev, never a PR); otherwise stay on the branch and say so. 3. Queued questions, one per
call, by tier; an answer that unblocks tasks ⇒ run them now, repeat from 1. 4. Recap in Spanish: done/parked,
commits, deviations, mode/model per task, dispatch count. 5. Update the handoff section with what stayed parked.
Never an automatic deploy — a deploy task is a queued question, always.

Before merge or push, determine whether the action triggers a production deploy; if it does, park it as a hard-stop and ask the queued deploy question before proceeding.

## Precedence

While this skill is active it overrides ONLY the pause rules of `execution-rules` (one phase per turn, stop on
any deviation, plan-revision approval, "wait for approval"), of `phased-approval` (OK between phases) and of
`superpowers:executing-plans` / `writing-plans` (review checkpoints, execution-mode prompt); the active runtime's
global instruction file (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` or `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`) carries the matching clause. Everything else stays in force: verification, UI validation, no phantom progress,
context thresholds, `backup-before-modify`, `db-backup`, `lint-and-validate`, `investigate-before-asking`,
`ui-validation-protocol`, `token-aware-authoring`, `workflow-resilience`, `no-yesman`, `project-context`.
`goal` is imported by reference (its two stop motives, its prohibitions), not activated.

## Rationalization table

| Excuse | Reality |
|---|---|
| "No estás delante, así que una pregunta bloqueante solo congelaría la sesión" | Nothing freezes: the task is parked, the rest runs, the question is asked at Close and waits. A notification is not an answer. |
| "T6 está en el plan aprobado y me dijiste que no pida OK" / "bajo tu autorización" / "autorización total" | An approved plan and blanket authorisation cannot cover a hard-stop item. Park it, ask once at Close, do everything else. |
| "Con rollback automático / monitor / preflight el deploy es seguro" | Mitigation ≠ permission. A deploy with rollback is still a deploy. |
| "Si el LB pinea por IP, despliego" / "si la suite está verde, despliego" | No technical condition self-authorises a hard-stop item. |
| "Lo que hay es una puerta, no una pregunta" | A gate the run passes alone is exactly the stop the list forbids. |
| "Todas las tasks las hago yo (Fable); delegar tarda más; un deploy no se delega" | ≥3 runnable specified tasks ⇒ SDD with runtime-resolved implementation/judgment models. Delegation cost is not a predicate. |
| "Revisor `fable`: ahí quiero el modelo más fuerte" | Fable never in a subagent, in any role. Final review uses the judgment model. |
| "T3 antes: es `[asap]` y más pequeño" / "nada llega a prod hasta T6, así que el orden no cambia" | Order = tier, then urgent tasks unblocked, then severity. Size and "it all ships together" are not keys. |
| "Sin plan escrito: código directo; las decisiones las declaro en vez de consultarlas" | No source ⇒ the permission question ⇒ forging → writing-plans ⇒ GO. Code before a plan is the failure. |
| "Si una tarea resulta insegura la salto y lo cuento en el informe" | Skip ≠ park. Parked = reason in the run-log + queued question in the selected mechanism's format. |
| "Una sola respuesta desbloquea T6 y T7 juntos" | One question per turn/call, ordered by tier. Bundling hides the recommendation. |
| "Me pidieron describir la interacción, así que cito la pregunta y después explico qué haré si responde" | The quoted plain-text question is still the terminal interaction. Stop at its `?`; post-answer work belongs to the next turn. |
| "El progreso está en los commits y en el informe" | Boxes + run-log rows are the persistence. Commits do not tell the next session what is parked and why. |
| "La task parked ya fue procesada, así que marco `[x]`" | `[x]` means completed, never processed. Keep every `parked:*` task `[ ]`; its latest run-log row prevents redispatch until the user unblocks it. |
| "Resuelvo lo de Redis yo mismo, es una decisión técnica" | A new external dependency is architectural ⇒ question. A renamed export is tactical ⇒ resolve. |
| "El Map especificado limita peor con tres réplicas, así que aparco la task como arquitectónica" | The approach is explicit and implementable: execute the Map, record the per-replica limitation as tactical, and carry it into the deploy question. Only changing the approach by adding Redis is architectural. |
| "`legacy/` es código trackeado, reversible con `git revert` ⇒ no es un stop" | Deletion is on the list by action, not by content. Reversible ≠ permitted. Inspect if you like — then park and ask. |
| "La task es grande, mejor confirmo antes" | Size is not a stop. Split into a sub-batch and keep going. |

## Red flags — STOP and re-read Stops

- About to run `deploy`, `rm -rf`, `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`, `push --force`, a payment or an email because the user pre-authorised it.
- About to replace a question with a PushNotification, a "gate", a "supuesto operativo" or an automatic rollback.
- Dispatching a subagent without the runtime-resolved model — or with `fable`.
- Executing in plan order without the tier table on screen.
- Two questions in one turn/call; a question before runnable work is exhausted.
- Any text after a plain-text question, including a recap or hypothetical post-answer steps.
- Writing code while no plan file exists.
- A task marked done with no `- [x]` and no run-log row.
- A `parked:*` task marked `[x]`, or a resumed parked task dispatched again without an explicit user answer.
- Adding a service, store or dependency the plan does not name, without a queued question.
- Parking an implementable task because its explicitly specified approach is weaker than expected; keep it runnable and record the tactical limitation.
- Inspecting a directory or table to decide whether deleting it "counts" as a stop.
